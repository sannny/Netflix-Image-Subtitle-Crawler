1
00:00:01,418 --> 00:00:03,086
So, what do you think?

2
00:00:03,128 --> 00:00:05,130
Wow.

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:08,175
It's for you, right?

4
00:00:08,216 --> 00:00:10,051
It's for both of us.

5
00:00:10,093 --> 00:00:11,094
Don't go away.

6
00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:12,763
Don't worry.

7
00:00:12,805 --> 00:00:15,599
There's no enough blood
left in my legs to go anywhere.

00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:21,188
CHARLIE (<i> on machine</i> ):
Hey, it's Charlie.

10
00:00:21,229 --> 00:00:22,773
Do your thing
when you hear the beep.

11
00:00:22,815 --> 00:00:23,941

WOMAN:
Listen, you lousy SOB.

13
00:00:25,776 --> 00:00:27,569
I will not be treated like this.

14
00:00:27,611 --> 00:00:30,990
Either you call me or you are
going to be very, very sorry.

15
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:33,116
I love you, Monkey Man.

16
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:34,075
Charlie?

17
00:00:36,328 --> 00:00:37,538
Who is that?

18
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:40,081
Damn telemarketers.

19
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:42,877
A telemarketer
who calls you "Monkey Man."

20
00:00:42,918 --> 00:00:45,587
I'm on some weird list.

21
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:50,009
Okay, it's a woman
I went out with once,

22
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:52,093
and she got a little clingy.

23
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:55,138
You are a bad, bad boy.

24
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:58,099
And yet, you're always
the one getting spanked.

25
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:00,936
(<i> phone rings</i> )

26
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:02,563
Geez.

27
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:04,356
CHARLIE (<i> on machine</i> ):
Hey, it's Charlie.

28
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:05,858
Do your thing
when you hear the beep.

Uh, Charlie, it-it's Alan,

31
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:10,362
uh, your brother.

32
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:11,613
No big deal.

33
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:13,657
Uh, just wanted to touch base.

34
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:15,158
My-my wife threw me out

35
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,077
and I'm kind of losing
the will to live.

36
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:18,662
So, when you get a chance,

37
00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:20,539
I'd really love to,
oh, I don't know...

38
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:22,958
Hey, Alan,
I'm sorry to hear about that.

39
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,793
Uh, so, where are you
going to go, to a hotel?

40
00:01:24,835 --> 00:01:26,545
Wow.

41
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:28,964
Huh?

42
00:01:29,006 --> 00:01:32,384
Well, yeah, I-I guess
you could... stay here.

43
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:34,553
Okay.

44
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:36,095
I'll see you
when you get here.

45
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:37,681
We better hurry.

46
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:48,316
Oh, is she staying over?

47
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:50,527
'Cause I may have parked
behind her.

âª<i> Men...</i> âª

50
00:01:57,701 --> 00:02:00,370
Twelve years
and-and she just throws me out.

51
00:02:00,412 --> 00:02:02,497
I mean, what was
the point of our
wedding vows?

52
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:03,916
You know,
"Till death do us part."

53
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:04,959
Who died? Not me, not her.

54
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,755
How did you get in my house?

55
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:13,341
Okay, Charlie, the key
in the fake rock only works

56
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:15,094
if it's among other rocks.

57
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:18,722
Not-not sitting on
your welcome mat.

58
00:02:18,764 --> 00:02:20,474
Excuse me,

59
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:23,351
but if you put the fake rock
in with a bunch of other rocks,

60
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:26,396
it's impossible to find
when you're drunk.

61
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:27,522
You know, I'm
a good husband.

62
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:28,690
I-I'm faithful.

63
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:29,900
Is she?

64
00:02:29,942 --> 00:02:31,026
Is she what?

65
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:32,193
Faithful.

66
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:35,072
(<i> scoffing</i> )

67
00:02:35,114 --> 00:02:36,448
Don't be ridiculous.

68
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,033
I mean,
Judith doesn't even like sex.

69
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:39,367
I mean, all she kept saying

70
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:40,995
was she feels suffocated,
you know.

71
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:42,079
She kept going on and on,

72
00:02:42,121 --> 00:02:43,246
"I'm suffocating.
I'm suffocating."

73
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:44,456
What does that mean?

74
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:46,166
Has a women ever said that
to you?

75
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:49,294
Well, yeah...

76
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:53,256
but not a woman who
doesn't like sex.

77
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:57,469
And-And Jake.
This could just destroy Jake.

78
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:58,470
Jake?

79
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:00,472
My son.

80
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:04,392
Oh, yeah, teenagers are pretty
sophisticated these days.

81
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:06,478
He's ten.

82
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,729
WOMAN:
Charlie,
I'm going to go.

83
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:09,272
CHARLIE:
Oh, no.

84
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:11,108
You two need to talk.
I'll call you tomorrow.

85
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,317
I'm sorry to hear
about you and your wife.

86
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:13,944
Oh, come on, you leaving

87
00:03:13,986 --> 00:03:15,946
isn't going to bring them
back together again.

88
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:21,785
Look, okay, this is just
until things settle out.

89
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:23,037
A couple of days max.

90
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:24,621
She will come to her senses.

91
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:27,916
Yeah, that's what women do.

92
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,461
Look,
you can have the guest room.

93
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:32,420
I'll grab some sheets.

94
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:33,630
That's okay.

95
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:35,340
I brought my own.

96
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:37,551
Brought your own sheets?

97
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:40,179
I like my sheets.

98
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,057
Okay, then, good night.

99
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:44,183
No, no, wait, wait.

100
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,475
Charlie, I mean,

101
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:47,352
we hardly ever
talk to each other.

102
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:50,147
(<i> sighs</i> ):
What do you want
to talk about, Alan?

103
00:03:50,189 --> 00:03:52,858
I don't know. Uh...

104
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,943
I was named
Chiropractor of the Year

105
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:58,113
by the San Fernando Valley
Chiropractic Association.

106
00:03:58,155 --> 00:03:58,906
Okay, then, good night.

107
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:00,281
No...

108
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:02,993
No, Charlie, Charlie,
what about you?

109
00:04:03,035 --> 00:04:05,495
What's, uh, what's
going on with you?

110
00:04:05,537 --> 00:04:07,539
Well, Alan,
there's not much to say.

111
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:10,542
I make a lot of money
for doing very little work.

112
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:14,295
I sleep with beautiful women
who don't ask about my feelings.

113
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:16,464
I drive a Jag,
I live at the beach,

114
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:18,008
and sometimes,
in the middle of the day,

115
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:19,634
for no reason at all,

116
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:22,846
I like to make myself
a big pitcher of margaritas,

117
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:24,765
take a nap out on the sundeck.

118
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:28,102
Huh.

119
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,605
Okay, then, good
night, Charlie.
Good night.

120
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:38,403
Good night, Monkey Man.

121
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:52,251
Boy, is your eye red.

122
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:56,337
You should see it from in here.

123
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:58,882
What are
you doing here, Jake?

124
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:00,383
My mom brought me.

125
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:03,137
Will you take me
swimming in the ocean?

126
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:09,184
(<i> sighs</i> ):
Can we talk about it
after my head stops exploding?

127
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:11,311
Why is your head exploding?

128
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:15,065
Well, I drank a little
too much wine last night.

129
00:05:15,107 --> 00:05:18,110
If it makes you feel bad,
why do you drink it?

130
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:21,989
Nobody likes
a wiseass, Jake.

131
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,408
You have to put a dollar
in the swear jar.

132
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,161
You said "ass."

133
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,330
Tell you what...
here's 20.

134
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:32,624
That should cover
me till lunch.

135
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:35,460
Now, what I think
you need to do

136
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:37,462
is to make a list.

137
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:40,215
On one side, put
what you don't like
about our marriage,

138
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:42,050
and on the other
side, what you do.

139
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:44,636
Alan, sometimes when I think
about coming home to you,

140
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:47,430
I start crying in my car.

141
00:05:49,308 --> 00:05:52,936
Okay, that would probably
go on the "don't" side.

142
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:54,271
Why would I lie?

143
00:05:54,313 --> 00:05:56,815
The ocean is closed today.

144
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:58,066
For God's sake, Charlie,

145
00:05:58,108 --> 00:05:59,776
do you think you could put
some pants on?

146
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:01,069
Look at me, Judy.

147
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:02,279
I could barely make it
down the stairs.

148
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:06,074
Uh, Charlie, could
you and Jake, uh...

149
00:06:06,116 --> 00:06:07,450
Yeah. Come on, kid.

150
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:09,286
We'll have breakfast
out on the deck.

151
00:06:09,328 --> 00:06:10,662
I already had breakfast.

152
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:12,080
Okay, we'll have lunch.

153
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:13,290
Not lunchtime.

154
00:06:13,332 --> 00:06:15,667
(<i> imitates explosion</i> )

155
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:18,377
That's his head exploding.

156
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:22,216
Judith, I-I can change.

157
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:24,176
Oh, please, Alan.

158
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:27,054
You are the most rigid,
inflexible, obsessive,

159
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:29,097
anal-retentive man
I've ever met.

160
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:31,850
Rigid and inflexible?

161
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:36,355
Don't you think that's
a little... redundant?

162
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:51,370
My mom and dad are splitting up.

163
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:52,579
Yeah, looks that way.

164
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,831
You're lucky.

165
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:56,208
When I was your age,

166
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:59,460
I could only dream about my
parents splitting up.

167
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:01,671
Your mom is my grandma.

168
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:03,173
Yup.

169
00:07:03,215 --> 00:07:06,425
Grandma says
you're a bitter disappointment.

170
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:10,055
Hey, sport.

171
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:11,598
Uh, your mom wants
to say good-bye.

172
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:16,477
Uh, listen,

173
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:19,064
he doesn't know anything
about what's going on

174
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:20,982
so let's just keep this
to ourselves.

175
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:22,234
Our little secret.

176
00:07:22,276 --> 00:07:25,070
Wh-Why is she saying
good-bye to him?

177
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:27,239
Oh, well, she's going
to be spending the weekend

178
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:29,908
with her sister... in Vegas.

179
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,327
uh, so, we decided
that Jake would stay with me.

180
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:34,495
With you?

181
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,456
Well, with us.

182
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:38,458
I'm hungry.

183
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:40,210
Is this going
to be a problem?

184
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:49,386
I guess not.

185
00:07:49,428 --> 00:07:50,762
Thanks.
Oh, uh, hey, listen.

186
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,347
I've got to call
my office.

187
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:54,015
Would you mind
making him lunch?

188
00:07:57,311 --> 00:07:58,478
Sure.

189
00:07:58,519 --> 00:07:59,438
Thanks.

190
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:04,109
What are you smiling about?

191
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:05,110
You don't have any food.

192
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:08,947
Yeah, but I'm not the one
who's hungry.

193
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:12,575
Who's smiling now, shorty?

194
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:16,037
CHARLIE:
You drink milk?

195
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:18,623
Just with cereal.

196
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:20,375
Okay.

197
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:21,626
Not that milk.

198
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:23,795
That milk.

199
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:25,964
What's the difference?

200
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:27,757
That's DairyFarm.

201
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:29,843
We drink DairyBarn.

202
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,430
Fine.

203
00:08:33,472 --> 00:08:34,514
Happy?

204
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:36,975
Why would I be happy?

205
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,601
It's just milk.

206
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:40,561
Cute.

207
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:43,357
Keep it up,
you'll be on one of the cartons.

208
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:50,030
Okay, cereal.

209
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:52,073
We got Lucky Charms,
Cocoa Puffs,

210
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:53,616
Frosted Flakes,
Maple Loops...

211
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:55,160
I want Maple Loops.

212
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:57,287
âª It's got oats and corns
and wheat âª

213
00:08:57,329 --> 00:08:59,414
âª It's the sweetest
breakfast treat âª

214
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:03,293
BOTH:
âª It's maple, maple,
ma... ple-icious! âª

215
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,338
You know who wrote that song?

216
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,130
Your Uncle Charlie wrote that.

217
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:08,131
No lie?

218
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:09,466
Kid, if I was going to lie,

219
00:09:09,508 --> 00:09:11,009
I'd say I wrote
"Stairway to Heaven"

220
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:12,093
not "The Maple Loop Song."

221
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:16,264
You two
are really good together.

222
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:17,432
Thank you.

223
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:19,434
So, does your wife sing, too?

224
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:20,435
Oh, uh, no.

225
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:21,269
I'm not married.

226
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:23,271
Oh. What a shame.

227
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:28,609
Wow...

228
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:31,779
you're even better
than a dog.

229
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,410
Dr. Bloom. Yes, yes.

230
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:37,869
This is, uh, Alan Harper.

231
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:39,413
Yes. My wife and I need

232
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:42,082
to cancel our marriage
counseling appointment

233
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:43,375
for this afternoon.

234
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:46,503
Yes, well, well,
something came up.

235
00:09:46,545 --> 00:09:47,628
Well, it's-it's-it's
kind of personal.

236
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,256
I mean, I-I-I...

237
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:52,592
Well, yeah, I know the
point of these things is...

238
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:56,971
I've got to go.

239
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,348
Um, hello?

240
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:00,058
Is Charlie home?

241
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,768
Uh, uh, no. I'm, uh,
I'm Charlie's brother.

242
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:04,020
Can I, uh, can
I help you?

243
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:06,523
Oh, hi, Charlie's brother.

244
00:10:06,565 --> 00:10:07,566
I'm Rose.

245
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:10,944
I'm Charlie's housekeeper.

246
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:12,487
So you're-you're
a housekeeper?

247
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:14,573
Well, housekeeper, slash,
actress, slash, hand model.

248
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:15,949
(<i> laughs</i> )

249
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,368
I just do this
to keep the wolf from the door.

250
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:20,412
(<i> roars</i> )

251
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:21,913
(<i> laughs</i> )

252
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:23,373
You know what I mean?

253
00:10:23,415 --> 00:10:25,459
Sure. Sure, come on in. Uh...

254
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:30,338
Oh.

255
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,424
Yeah, I can smell him.

256
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:36,136
Smell who?

257
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:37,220
Your brother.

258
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:39,473
He has a very musky scent.

259
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:43,477
Uh-huh.

260
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:48,398
Well, I'll just, uh...
let you get to work.

261
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,358
Oh, wait.

262
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:55,614
Oh, no. It's okay.

263
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:00,535
âª It's got oats
and corns and wheat âª

264
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:01,995
âª It's the sweetest
breakfast treat âª

265
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:03,497
âª It's maple, maple, maa.... âª

266
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:06,833
Jake, buddy,
take a break.

267
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:08,876
ALAN: What, uh...
What took you so long?

268
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:11,963
We stopped for ice cream
'cause I'm a babe magnet.

269
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:16,717
I got to take a squirt.

270
00:11:19,262 --> 00:11:22,265
Why do you assume
he learned that from me?

271
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:24,017
Because<i> I</i> learned it from you.

272
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:27,854
Hey, thanks for cleaning up.

273
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:29,063
Oh, it wasn't me.

274
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:30,273
Rose was here.

275
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:31,608
Rose?

276
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:32,900
You let Rose into my house?

277
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,693
She said she was your maid.

278
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:36,237
What the hell.

279
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:38,072
She glued the damned cabinets
shut again.

280
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,699
Again? You've got somebody

281
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:43,077
who comes in regularly
to glue your cabinets?

282
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:45,079
Oh, you've met some
of the whack jobs

283
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:46,164
I've gone out with.

284
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:47,624
It's not that big a stretch.

285
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:49,417
Oh, oh. So this is my fault.

286
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:50,585
Who let her in?

287
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:53,588
Oh, you are a deeply
disturbed man.

288
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,131
Oh, I'm deeply disturbed?

289
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:56,675
Who showed up here in
the middle of the night

290
00:11:56,715 --> 00:11:57,884
with his own sheets?

291
00:11:57,925 --> 00:11:59,553
Hey, at least I care
what I sleep on,

292
00:11:59,594 --> 00:12:00,719
or should I say,
<i>who</i> I sleep on.

293
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:03,640
Hey, pal, of
the two of us,

294
00:12:03,682 --> 00:12:05,058
I'll bet I'm
the only one

295
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:07,227
who slept with a
married woman recently.

296
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:08,853
EVELYN:
And isn't that something

297
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:10,355
to brag about?

298
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:12,607
(<i> thudding</i> )

299
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:16,027
Hi, Mom.

300
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:19,822
EVELYN:
Do you have any idea
how hurtful it is

301
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:21,575
to hear about
your own son's divorce

302
00:12:21,616 --> 00:12:23,660
on the street?

303
00:12:23,702 --> 00:12:24,619
What divorce?

304
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:26,120
Wh-what street?

305
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:28,540
How did you get in my house?

306
00:12:28,582 --> 00:12:30,458
You stay out of this.

307
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,878
I'm here to help your brother
through a very difficult time.

308
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,048
How could you do this to me?

309
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,550
Do what?

310
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:40,260
Now when I want
to see my grandson,

311
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:41,928
I am going to have
to make an appointment

312
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:43,597
with Judith,

313
00:12:43,638 --> 00:12:46,558
who-- let's face it--
was never very warm to me.

314
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,727
And what if
there's another man there,

315
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,144
shacking up with her?

316
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:52,063
Have you even stopped
to consider that?

317
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:59,654
I think he's considering it
now, Mom.

318
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:01,364
Here's your
iced tea, Grandma.

319
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:03,157
Oh, thank you,
my little angel.

320
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:04,867
Oh, darling, I asked
for a lemon wedge.

321
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:10,957
All right, here's what
you're going to do.

322
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:13,209
You and Jake will come live
with me.

323
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:14,628
After all, I'm just

324
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:17,088
rattling around
in that big house all by myself.

325
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,506
Mom, that's very considerate,

326
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:20,717
but as soon
as Judith and I work things out,

327
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:22,510
I'm going to be back
at my own house.

328
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:25,513
Oh, sweetheart, grow up.

329
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:28,558
Think about
what I said.

330
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,687
You're my son, and I'll always
have room for you in my house

331
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:34,689
and in my heart.

332
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:37,358
I-I love you, too, Mom.

333
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:48,953
I love you, too, Mom.

334
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:51,623
Too little. Too late.

335
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:55,794
So, Vegas was good?

336
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:57,462
It was fine.

337
00:13:57,504 --> 00:13:59,213
Alan, I really
want to apologize

338
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:00,757
for putting you
through this.

339
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:02,550
I was wrong to blame you
for my unhappiness.

340
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:03,968
No. No need
to apologize.

341
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,886
What's important is
that we're here,

342
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:07,681
and we're working
on our marriage.

343
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:09,098
You look great,
by the way.

344
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,266
Must be all the

345
00:14:10,308 --> 00:14:12,059
extra oxygen they pump
into the casinos.

346
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:13,770
Alan...
And-and-and-and
you were right.

347
00:14:13,812 --> 00:14:16,606
I-I see now that the time apart
did us both a lot of good.

348
00:14:16,648 --> 00:14:17,565
I know I've grown.

349
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:19,025
I am not that suffocating guy

350
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:21,277
you threw out of the house
four and half days ago.

351
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:22,654
Let me tell you that.

352
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:23,946
Alan...
And Jake's doing fine.

353
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:25,156
I know you were concerned

354
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:26,616
about him
being around my brother,

355
00:14:26,658 --> 00:14:28,284
but it turns out
Charlie's great with kids.

356
00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:31,162
All right, last card,

In.

361
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:40,087
I'll see the dollar

362
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:42,131
and raise it five.

363
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:45,468
You raised $5 on<i> that?</i>

364
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:46,678

365
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,679
Call.
Call.

366
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:48,471
Call.

00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,478
Hey, kid, don't you know
what a full house is?

370
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,480
Yeah, and I also know
what a psych-out is.

371
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:00,316
CHARLIE:
I love this boy.

372
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:03,486
And-and-and I think

373
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:05,154
that we're going
to look back on this

374
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:05,946
as-as a new beginning

375
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:07,323
for our marriage,

376
00:15:07,365 --> 00:15:08,700
a rebirth, a Renaissance,
if you will.

377
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:10,910
Alan, I think I'm gay.

378
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:15,956
All right.

379
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,043
We'll make a list.

380
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:24,048
On one side,
we'll put gay stuff...

381
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,676
I'll see you...

382
00:15:26,718 --> 00:15:28,678
and raise you 20.

383
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:33,892
I think he's got you, pal.

384
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,518
He's bluffing.

385
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:39,397
He always pulls his ear
when he bluffs.

386
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:41,399
How about it, Mighty Mouse?

387
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:43,484
You in?

388
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:46,446
Take him down.

389
00:15:49,908 --> 00:15:51,910

00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:54,495
I hate this kid.

What the hell is going on here?

392
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:00,126
You said "hell."

00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:03,588
Throw a dollar in the pot.

394
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,131
What?

395
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:06,925
Hey, we all had to.

396
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:10,762
Charlie, may I speak with you
privately, please?

397
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,139
Whose deal is it?

398
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,181
ALAN:
Jake, go to bed!

399
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:15,725
I'm out.

400
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:16,976
What is wrong with you?

401
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:18,185
Are you insane?

402
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:19,604
Do you have any sense
of right and wrong?

403
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:21,773
Probably not. How was dinner?

404
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:24,358
How could you put Jake
in a poker game
with grown men?

405
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,737
I obviously can't be trusted.

406
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:29,447
So, how was dinner?

407
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:31,031
I leave you
alone with him

408
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:32,659
for a couple of hours.
I mean, it's just...

409
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,827
I'm just going
to keep asking, Alan.

410
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:35,411
Dinner was swell.

411
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:38,080
We both had the veal piccata,
and she's gay.

412
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,501
Wow.

413
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:45,338
Most chicks won't eat veal.

414
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:48,424
Why do I even try
talking to you?

415
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:50,050
Oh, come on.

416
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:52,261
I'm just trying to get you
to lighten up a little.

417
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:53,554
I don't need
to lighten up.

418
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:54,597
The world I
live in is dark.

419
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:55,807
Dark and rainy.

420
00:16:55,849 --> 00:16:56,975
And you're
useless in it.

421
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,518
Oh, really?

422
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,937
I wasn't useless
when you needed a place to stay.

423
00:17:00,979 --> 00:17:03,731
Well, obviously,
that was a mistake.

424
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:06,359
Are you sure?

425
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,235
Maybe we should make a list.

426
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:12,239

What's going on?

429
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:27,005
Can't sleep?

430
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,715
No.

431
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:32,635
My dad says we're moving
to Grandma's tomorrow.

432
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:35,596
Yeah. That'd keep me up.

433
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:40,643
You know, if it makes
you feel any better,

434
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:41,978
you won 80 bucks
in that last hand.

435
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,187
85.

436
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:45,815
80. House gets a cut.

437
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:49,068
I wish my dad was as cool
as you.

438
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:50,695
Hey, don't sell
your dad short.

439
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:53,280
He loves you more than
anything in the world.

440
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:55,115
You know that,
don't you?

441
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:56,784
I guess.

442
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:03,875
How come
you don't have any kids?

443
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:06,168
I don't know.

444
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:10,089
Maybe because I love<i> me</i>
more than anything in the
world.

446
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:14,468
Yeah?

00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,178
I don't want to go to Grandma's.

448
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,013
I'd rather stay here.

449
00:18:18,765 --> 00:18:22,643
Yeah, well, your dad knows
what's best for you.

450
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:24,478
Okay.

451
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,981
Good night, Uncle Charlie.

00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:28,608
I love you.

00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:32,612
Yeah.

00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:34,572
Okay.

You got to love
a kid like that.

I even played him
"Stairway to Heaven,"

458
00:18:47,752 --> 00:18:49,796

Maple Loops song better.

I haven't seen you
in two weeks.

461

Now, do you want to talk
about your nephew,

462
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:57,637
or do you want to have sex?

463
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:58,972
Oh, sex.

464
00:18:59,013 --> 00:19:00,974
Definitely sex.

465
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:08,188
Let me ask you
something.

466
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,649
Yeah?

Do you ever think
about having kids?

Whoa, Charlie,

to have sex.

Hi, Monkey Man.

00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:34,924
I was just thinking
about you

480

why we hurt each other so much.

00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:45,643
Yeah. Hey, listen,
let me ask you a question.

485
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:47,227
Is there something
inherently wrong

486
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:49,147
with asking a woman
you're involved with

487
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,356
if she wants kids?

488
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:51,816
Oh, Charlie.

00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:53,109
We got a good thing going.

490
00:19:53,151 --> 00:19:54,443
Why do you want to mess it up?

How good do you feel
about yourself right now?

On a scale of one to two.

497
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:10,918
I'm not back living with Mom.

498
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,211
I'm simply staying here

work things out.

500
00:20:14,005 --> 00:20:17,216
So... one?

What do you want, Charlie?

502
00:20:18,843 --> 00:20:21,261
Well, I figured you been
here a couple of weeks.

503
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:23,430
You got to have blood
in your stool by now.

504
00:20:30,104 --> 00:20:32,773
So I thought if you and
Jake wanted to come back

505
00:20:32,815 --> 00:20:35,359
to my place for a while,
that that'd be okay.

506

Wait a minute. Are you saying

507
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:38,654
you want me to come back
and live with you?

508
00:20:38,696 --> 00:20:40,990
Well, truthfully, no.

509

I want Jake to come back

you're a package deal.

ongoing basis.

to stop blaming your mother

539
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:41,383
Here, I got you
your own key.

540
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:46,097
âª Men. âª

541
00:21:47,974 --> 00:21:49,433
I am not comfortable with this.

542
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:51,144
I mean, maybe I should go
wait in the car.

543
00:21:51,185 --> 00:21:52,478
You're not waiting
in the car.

544
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:54,105
Trust me. This is a
great way to meet women.

545
00:21:54,147 --> 00:21:55,231
I don't want to meet women.

546
00:21:55,273 --> 00:21:56,690
I'm still married.
Oh, come on.

547
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:58,151
You're wife's out
meeting chicks.

548
00:21:58,192 --> 00:21:59,026
Why shouldn't you?

549
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:01,862
âª It's got oats
and corn and wheat âª

550
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:04,364
âª It's the sweetest
breakfast treat âª

551
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:06,575
âª It's maple, maple,
ma... ple-icious! âª

552
00:22:06,617 --> 00:22:08,619
Your son is just adorable.

553
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:10,663
Oh, thank you.

554
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:11,705
You and your...

555
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:13,707
life partner must be so proud.

556
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:20,214
You're right.

557
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:21,632
Go wait in the car.
